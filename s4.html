        My name is Diana Oh and I am from and currently reside in Los Angeles. I obtained a bachelor’s degree in psychology from UCLA and after graduating worked in ad operations at Hulu for four years. Working at a technology and entertainment company allowed me to learn what software engineers do and the different roles within a technical team.  While at Hulu, I worked closely with the ad platform developers and grew increasingly fascinated by what they did. The ad platform team at Hulu is responsible for creating the ad interface used by the ad operations team, fixing any subsequent ad interface issues, and making occasional changes to the ad serving algorithms. The ad platform team worked closely with select members of my department including myself on helping maintain and improve the ad user interface. I was intrigued each time I communicated UX feature requests to the product managers from the ad platform team and got to subsequently interact with the feature I helped design on the ad interface.  I moreover became very interested in engineering and its implications and thought segueing into this sector would help me best achieve my ultimate goal, which is to work in a profession dedicated to improving the world in a consequential way.

        After much thought, I decided to attend OSU and pursue a formal degree in computer science. I thought undergoing formal education would be best since it would allow me to ultimately apply to graduate programs. After graduating, I plan to pursue a master's degree in computer science and in five to ten years, I would like to work in the artificial intelligence sector and help develop safe A.I. Artificial intelligence is poised to become a disruptive and seemingly inevitable innovation in our world, and I would like to ensure that it gets created in a safe way and make sure its benefits are evenly distributed.

        Aside from my interest in computer science, I enjoy reading quotes by people I admire, shopping for clothes, and eating foods I like with loved ones. I also enjoy creating art. More specifically, I like to make sketches and paint pictures of animals.

        My previous programming experience has involved learning to code on Codeacademy in addition to learning C++ through OSU. I have had a year’s experience with this language. I have taken CS161,CS162, and CS225 at OSU. Aside from this class, I am also currently enrolled in CS271 and CS290.  I have developed on Windows, and the IDE I use is MS Visual Studio.
