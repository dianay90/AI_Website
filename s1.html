<p id="headers1"> A.I. Today </p>

    
    
<p id="s1p">Many companies are focused on developing artificial general intelligence, which is intelligence in which a machine can do what a human can. Creating artificial intelligence has many potentially dangerous implications that we need to be wary of. Creating an entity that is more intelligent than humans does not guarantee that humans will retain control over what they created. Thus it is imperative that its inception be introduced
    in a way in which human life will not be and will continue to not be threatened. As such, this website aims to teach readers what artificial intelligence 
    is, where it stands today, and why it is important to be cautious of this technology. This website also seeks to teach readers about artificial intelligence, as we believe the best preventative measure will derive from first understanding how AI will be made. We believe that although we most likely cannot stop AI from being created, we can do our part in ensuring that it gets created to benefit people or at the very least prevent them from being harmed. </p>

    Artificial general intelligence is achieved when a machine can perform any intellectual task that a human can (source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). Two notable companies that are spreadheading efforts towards solving intelligence are Deepmind and OpenAI. Deepmind's focus is integrating neuroscience with machine learning to solve intelligence. Below is a video from Deepmind's CEO, Demis Hassabis, giving a brief lecture on how his company plans to tackle the AI problem.
